# Natural Logarithm of Square Root 2π

> [Natural logarithm][@stdlib/math/base/special/ln] of the [square root][@stdlib/math/base/special/sqrt] of [2π][@stdlib/constants/float64/pi].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var LN_SQRT_TWO_PI = require( '@stdlib/constants/float64/ln-sqrt-two-pi' );
```

#### LN_SQRT_TWO_PI

[Natural logarithm][@stdlib/math/base/special/ln] of the [square root][@stdlib/math/base/special/sqrt] of [2π][@stdlib/constants/float64/pi].

```javascript
var bool = ( LN_SQRT_TWO_PI === 0.9189385332046728 );
// returns true
```
